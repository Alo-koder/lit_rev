## Foundations

* Turing 1952: _The chemical basis of morphogenesis_
	* Predicts/explains that chemical oscillations can only occur when there's a significant difference between concentration timescale for two reagents
	* For our system, potential is the other 'reagent' -- that's why it works
	* Important terminology -- 'reaction-diffusion system'
	* Some kind of auto-catalysis is key; activator-inhibitor system
	* This is more about stationary patterns

* Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction
	* Hard to point at one particular paper; the originals are not available online
	* Discovered by Belousov in 1959: _A periodic reaction and its mechanism_
	* Theory by Nicolis and Prigogine 1977: _Self-Organization in Nonequilibrium Systems_
		* Due to detailed balance, oscillations only possible far from equilibrium

## System basics

* Uhlir 1955:  _Electrolytic Shaping of Germanium and Silicon_
	* First ever paper on the reaction
	* Discovery of electropolishing

* Turner 1958: _Electropolishing Silicon in Hydrofluoric Acid Solutions_
	* _Second_ paper about the process in general
	* Already mentions oscillations

* Gerischer 1988: _Electrolytic Growth and Dissolution of Oxide Layers on Silicon in Aqueous Solutions of Fluorides_
	* Confirms the crucial role of electron holes in the reaction of illuminated n-type silicon

## Oscillation mechanism models

* Aggour 1995: _Interface condition of n-Si(111) during photocurrent oscillations in NH4F solutions_
	* _Claims that oscillations are caused by pores opening and closing

* Carstensen 1999: _A Model for Current-Voltage Oscillations at the Silicon Electrode and Comparison with Experimental Results_

* Lehmann 1996: _On the Origin of Electrochemical Oscillations at Silicon Electrodes_
	* A stress dependent transition occurs; from a flat, dense, isolating layer to a rough structure of a certain thickness. As a result, ionic permeability and the etch rate increase.


## Coupling mechanism

* Chazalviel 1992: _The p-Si/fluoride interface in the anodic region: damped and/or sustained oscillations_
	* External resistance means more coupling and more oscillations

	* Holes as non-local coupling

##### Network dynamics
* Norton 2019: _Dynamics of reaction-diffusion oscillators in star and other networks with cyclic symmetries exhibiting multiple clusters_
	* network dynamics in BZ reaction -- a reaction-diffusion system
	* claims that there's no experimental studies on network dynamics
