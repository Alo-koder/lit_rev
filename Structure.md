### Abstract

### Introduction

* Nonlinear dynamics as a science, mostly done by mathematicians/physicists but applied to biology (neuroscience + biological clocks)
* Intro to the system, basic properties thereof
* #important Chemical osc. as an ensemble of 10^23 small oscillators -- perfect sandbox to explore network dynamics


### Theoretical Foundations

As we know, this is many small oscillators (smooth transition from intro). There are two main questions to ask:
* Why do they synchronise? What is coupling, synchronisation etc? Here reference Kuramoto and Winfree
* How is pattern formation possible? BZ, Turing


### Oscillation mechanism

Here we summarise the efforts to fully understand why a single domain wants to oscillate
* Pores/brake-throughs
* Smoothly varying oxide quality
* etc etc

### Coupling mechanism

How are the oscillators coupled in our case? Can we fine-tune it?
* Global coupling by voltage
* Non-local holes
* Adaptive coupling? Whatever that is

### Spatio-temporal patterns

A traditional list of whatever interesting was observed recently
* HAO and LAO -- birhythmicity
* Bichaoticity (chimeras)
* Spatial pattern formation

### Conclusions and Future Outlook

* Small networks of oscillators (Max Tost)
* Obtaining the PRC
