### Title: Oscillations during anodic electrodissolution of silicon

0. Abstract
1. Introduction
	* Chemical oscillations -- thought to be impossible, but then Zhabotinsky ❗❗Actually, reactions similar to what I do were known earlier. That impossible thing was about oscillations in a _closed_ system❗❗
	* _"One of the most intensely studied electrochemical reactions"_ ([[Schönleber2012.pdf]], 1st intro sentence)
	* Similarly to the Zhabotinsky reaction, instead of simply approaching the thermodynamical equilibrium, it oscillates
	* Interesting, because it can be used for studies of nonlinear oscillators (citing papers of my research group)
2. Discussion
	1. Discovery
		1. Silicon electropolishing: [[Uhlir 1955]], [[Turner 1958]]
	2. Characteristics of the reaction -- observations
		1. Regimes: dampened for voltage < 3.5V, sustained for 3.5-8V, chaotic >8V; [[Gerischer 1988]] 
		2. Oxide layer thickness also oscillates => simple diagram of a feedback mechanism
		3. Different types of oscillations: "low-" and "high amplitude"
		4. The role of external resistance: [[Schönleber 2012]]
	3. Reaction mechanism
		1. Although there were many propositions during last 30 years, we're still not fully sure
		2. First attempts: dramatic change in oxide layer properties
		3. Approach 2: on the atomic scale, system always oscillates, but the individual domains only become synchronised in special conditions
		4. Approach 3: smooth variations of oxide layer quality
3. Conclusions & Future Outlook
	1. Although it was researched for a long time, there are still gaps in understanding, e.g. we don't yet have a system of differential equations governing the oscillatory behaviour
	2. We'd like to know more about coupling caused by voltage interaction, therefore we need a phase response function (this is what my research is going to be)
	3. System can be used as a model for studying non-linearly coupled networks of oscillators
