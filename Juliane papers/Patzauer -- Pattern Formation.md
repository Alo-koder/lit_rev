**Autonomous Oscillations and Pattern Formation with Zero External Resistance during Silicon Electrodissolution**

> In this paper, we present experiments that focus on further insights into the impact of the spatial coupling through valence band holes on pattern formation. Therefore, no external resistance is used throughout. We first show that self-sustained current oscillations with a very small amplitude also exist without an external ohmic series resistance for both p-type and highly illuminated n-type electrodes. Then, we demonstrate that reducing the illumination of n-type Si leads to a spatial symmetry breaking, and even to the coexistence of coherently and incoherently oscillating parts of the electrode surface, reminiscent of chimera states.

* Shows that spatial coupling without global coupling (without external resistance) produces spatial waves/patterns
* Quite basic to be honest, not sure if worth a subsection
* The setup and procedures really are 95% the same as mine
