**Birhythmicity, intrinsic entrainment, and minimal chimeras in an electrochemical experiment**

* We knew that HAOs and LAOs exist (citation needed)
* Extrinsic vs intrinsic coupling:
	* extrinsic means two different electrodes connected electrically
	* intrinsic is the influence of the LAO limit cycle in phase space on HAOs. HAO starts behaving differently because of the proximity to another stable oscillation, which is LAO.
