**The chemical basis of morphogenesis**

* A very long paper (45 pages)
* Predicts/explains that chemical oscillations can only occur when there's a significant difference between diffusion speeds for two reagents
* For our electrochemical system, potential assumes the role of the other reagent -- that's why it works
