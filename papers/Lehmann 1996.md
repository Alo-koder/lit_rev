**On the Origin of Electrochemical Oscillations at Silicon Electrodes**

* A stress dependent transition occurs; from a flat, dense, isolating layer to a rough (porous?) structure of a certain thickness. As a result, ionic permeability and the etch rate increase.

* Nice figure (page 6, top-right). Note -- eq. of the EMSI signal is the dotted line: ![[Lehmann1996_fig8.png]]
