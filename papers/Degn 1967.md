**Theory of Electrochemical Oscillations**

* Aims to explain oscillations without specific assumptions about chemical mechanism
* Theory fully based on three aspects: external resistance, negative differential resistance, concentration polarization (which means something like a double-layer causing potential drop)
* Has some interesting graphs with N-shaped current vs voltage and fixed points found graphically
