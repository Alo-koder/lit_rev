**High-Amplitude versus Low-Amplitude Current Oscillations during the Anodic Oxidation of p-Type Silicon in Fluoride Containing Electrolytes**

* #question Why are they measuring potential instead of current?
* This is most likely the ___crucial___ paper explaining what's going on
* Suggests an explanation of the difference between these oscillations
* A qualitative difference in silicon oxide quality between High and Low Amp oscillations. Etch-back curves for LA are smooth => uniform oxide. For HA this is not the case.
