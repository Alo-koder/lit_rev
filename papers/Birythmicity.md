**Birhythmicity, intrinsic entrainment, and minimal chimeras in an electrochemical experiment**

* Easily the most important paper of them all, I'm directly continuing it
* Low amplitude osc. are more sensitive to voltage, while HAOs are less
* "There has to be a third important parameter, bc the phase space paths intersect" -- well, not really, because the voltage is different, innit?
