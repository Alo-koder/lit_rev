1. Introduction
	1. Non linear dynamics -- what is it about, maybe little history, modern day applications
	2. (Electro)chemical oscillations: Turing
	3. The system: experimental setup, history, description, mechanisms
2. Discussion
	1. The system: recent updates??? maybe not?
	2. Coupled oscillators
	3. Multifrequency clusters/birythmicity?
	4. Chimera states
