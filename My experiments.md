Title idea: The Coupling Mechanism in an Osc. Silicon Electro-Dissolution System

* PRC in voltage for low amp. osc.
* PRC in light for both (?)
* differential equations for system evolution
* third parameter (please c:) -- is it oxide quality?? maybe porosity???


Interesting questions:  

* Can we measure porosity in situ in real time? 
My answer: what we can do for sure is stop the experiment and measure etch-back derivative ([[Schönleber 2012]], pages 4-5)  

* Estimate F- ion transport. Can their local concentration be time-dependent? (most likely no)
* Measure the SiO_x layer for both cases and compare!?
* Estimate system's inductance (❓I think this was already attempted❓). In principle, this can be done by integrating current peaks caused by U pert. How much time does it take for the system to catch up?
