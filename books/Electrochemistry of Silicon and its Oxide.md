## Chapter 5.10: Current Oscillation

1. Potential region: 1.5 to 8V (vs SCE); [[Lewerenz 1992]]
2. Required HF concentration: from 1.8% to 5%. Below we have damped oscillations, above we get chaos.
3. While both T and I depend on both V and conc. F-, it is found that I\*T = const in conc. F-. In other words, the amount of silicon dissolved during one oscillation is constant wrt F conc (and therefore etch rate -- my comment), only depends on voltage.
