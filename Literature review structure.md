## Take 3

### Title: Anodic electrodissolution of silicon -- an overview 

0. Abstract
1. Introduction
	* _"One of the most intensely studied electrochemical reactions"_ ([[Sch√∂nleber2012.pdf]], 1st intro sentence)
	* Widely (?? need to check if someone outside of our group is doing this) used for studies of nonlinear oscillators (üìëYuki's thesis, Juliane's thesis)
	* Porous silicon has some uses in photo-electronics [[Rauscher 2001]]
2. Discussion
	1. Discovery
		1. Silicon electropolishing: [[Uhlir 1955]], [[Turner 1958]]
	2. Characteristics of the reaction
		1. Regimes: electropolishing, oscillations; [[Gerischer 1988]] (?)
		2. The role of external resistance: [[Sch√∂nleber 2012]]
	3. Theoretical efforts
		1. Stability analysis: [[Rauscher 2001]]
	4. Non-linear coupling
		1. Yuki's thesis again
		2. 
3. Conclusions & Future Outlook
	1. Although it was researched for a long time, there are still gaps in understanding, e.g. we don't have a nice system of diff eq's yet
	2. Would be nice to finally fully understand the reaction mechanism
	3. We'd like to know more about coupling, therefore we need a phase response function

The book has an excellent chapter summarising the efforts in determining how the oscillations work. My topic has to be broader, or otherwise I could just copy that chapter heh. Instead of that, I should focus more on the 'cool' non-linear dynamics stuff from our research group... but what if I really just copy the book‚ùì
