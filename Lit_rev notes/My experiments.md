Title idea: The Mechanism of Coupling in an Osc. Silicon Electro-Dissolution System

* PRC in voltage for low amp. osc.
* PRC in light for both (?)
* differential equations for system evolution
* third parameter (please c:)


Interesting questions:

* Can we measure porosity in situ in real time? 
* Estimate F- ion transport. Can their local concentration be time-dependent? (most likely no)
* Measure the SiO_x layer for both cases and compare!?
* Estimate system's capacitance. In principle, this can be done by integrating current peaks caused by U pert. How much time does it take for the system to catch up?
