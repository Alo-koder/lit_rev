	* Nonlinear dynamics as a multidisciplinary science
	* System has potential, interesting results
	* 

2. Introduction 
	1. System
		1. Basics with [[Turner 1958]]
	2. Phase Response Functions
		1. Widespread in biology; give some article examples

Just an idea now -- I should write the review on the system as a whole, focusing on the chemistry/physics. I can include non-linear dynamics on top of that.
